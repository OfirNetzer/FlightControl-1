# FlightControl
Advanced Programming 2 course, Flight Simulator App

Created by: Almog Lev, Eyal Golan, Sapir Deutscher and Ofir Netzer.

## Preview

A flight control web application that interacts with a dedicated server. We built our frontend using Javascript, bootstrap and css,. The backend was built using C# and ASP.NET Core, and we created a RESTful API using WebAPI. Unit Tests were created using Moq.

The web application features a flight control system that presents current active flights, enables adding new flight plans and show details about each flight (it's path on a map, it's start time and arrival time, etc).
