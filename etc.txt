Unit test:
Our unit test creates all the objects that we are using in our program- 
Flight object, Flight Plan object, Initial Location object and Segment objects. Then, it adds them asynchronically to our data base.
when it's done filling the data base, it runs the GetFlights method with the test objects, gets the results and checks if they are correct.
